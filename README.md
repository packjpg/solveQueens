Matthias Stirner's own approach to the solution of the popular N Queens problem. 


SolveNQueens is my own approach to the solution of the popular N Queens problem. The N Queens problem is a mathematical problem roughly formulated as:
“How many ways are there to place N Queens on an NxN chess board so that none of them can capture each other?”

There are two variants of my solver in there, the real one called 'solveQueens.cpp' and the dumb approach called 'solveQueens_dumb.cpp'. Compile and run the two alongside to see the difference!

You may read more about the N Queens problem on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_queens_problem). Also, I advice you to check out [Jeff Somers’ excellent webpage](http://jsomers.com/nqueen_demo/nqueens.html) on this topic. His source code follows a different approach than mine, but also works much faster for bigger board sizes.

You may use the solveNQueens source code freely, under any license that you wish to use. The inspiration for this, by the way, came from one of the excellent [Professor Layton games for the Nintendo DS](http://professorlayton.nintendo.com/).
